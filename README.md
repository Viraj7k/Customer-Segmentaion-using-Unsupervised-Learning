 Project Description

 What is Customer Segmentation? 
 -> Customer segmentation is the process of identifying different groups of customers based on the category they belong such as demographics or behaviors so that the sales/marketing team can reach out to those specific customers effectively.

-> When you perform customer segmentation, you find similar characteristics in each customerâ€™s behaviour and needs. Then, those are generalized into 
 groups to satisfy demands with various strategies. Moreover, those strategies can be an input of the:

i) Focused marketing efforts on particular demographics
ii) Introduction of features in line with user deman
iii) Creation of the product roadmapap


We are going perform segmentation by using the following 3 algorithms

i) K-means
iii) DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Primary goal to help data supermarket increase their business by getting more memberships.
for this we will try and explore different clustering techniques and perform a customer segmentation. That is nothing but identifying and making groups based on some 
similar characteristics of customer preferences and purchasing history and allow companies to market to each gorup more efficiently. 
We shall further develop some clustering models to gain better understandidng of the type of the customer.
This includes clustering algorithms such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.
