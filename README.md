 Project Description

 What is Customer Segmentation? 
 -> Customer segmentation is the process of identifying different groups of customers based on the category they belong such as demographics or behaviors so that the sales/marketing team can reach out to those specific customers effectively.

-> When you perform customer segmentation, you find similar characteristics in each customer’s behaviour and needs. Then, those are generalized into 
 groups to satisfy demands with various strategies. Moreover, those strategies can be an input of the:

i) Focused marketing efforts on particular demographics
ii) Introduction of features in line with user deman
iii) Creation of the product roadmapap


We are going perform segmentation by using the following 3 algorithms

i) K-means
iii) DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Primary goal to help data supermarket increase their business by getting more memberships.
for this we will try and explore different clustering techniques and perform a customer segmentation. That is nothing but identifying and making groups based on some 
similar characteristics of customer preferences and purchasing history and allow companies to market to each gorup more efficiently. 
We shall further develop some clustering models to gain better understandidng of the type of the customer.
This includes clustering algorithms such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN.

Required Libraries
Ensure the following Python libraries installed:
•⁠  ⁠pandas: Use	d for data manipulation and analysis.
pip install pandas

•⁠  ⁠numpy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
pip install numpy

•⁠  ⁠matplotlib: Utilized for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
pip install matplotlib

•⁠  ⁠seaborn:  Based on matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
pip install seaborn

•⁠  ⁠sklearn: A machine learning library used for implementing clustering algorithms like K-means and DBSCAN.
pip install sklearn

Steps to Execute the Script:

Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the script (if the script reads from a file).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the script.

1.⁠ ⁠Prepare the Environment:
  Ensure to have Python installed on your system
  Python 3.7 or higher
  Jupyter Notebook

2. ⁠Install Required Libraries:
   Use the pip command provided above to install the necessary libraries.

3. Execute the Script:
   Run the script using a Python interpreter. You can do this by navigating to the directory     containing the script and running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
python /”Directory Path”/Final_Customer_Segmentation.py

Or you can execute in the Jupyter Notebook.

4.⁠ ⁠Review the Output:
   The script will perform customer segmentation using K-means and DBSCAN algorithms and output the results.

5.Expected Output
  ⁠Clustered data visualizations
  Printed output of cluster characteristics
